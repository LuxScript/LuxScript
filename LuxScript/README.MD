# IMPORTANT (Command)
**IMPORTANT**
Please note that this is a need to the programming language. Without this you cannot use the luxscript command.

Please create this file in the location "C:\Windows\System32\" and there create a file named "luxscript.bat" then add this to it:
```Batch
@echo off
python LuxScript\Command\index.py %*
node LuxScript\MAIN.js %*
```

# Start programming
Next to start programming LuxScript you just need to create a .lx file in the same folder where you installed LuxScript. Next you can load the file and execute the code by doing the command "luxscript TheNameOfYourFile" and then your done you have executed your first LuxScript file!
